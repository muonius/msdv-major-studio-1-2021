# Introduction
This is an ongoing documentation of my course progress of Major Studio 1 taken during my study at Parsons' Data Visualization MS porgram in Fall 2021.



## Current Progress

#### Class 3 - Quantatitive Research Outcome: 
Create 3 different quantitative visualization concepts with 3 different data sets. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.

### Sketch 1: Salesman's Note
(No Sally Should be Priced. No Sara Should be Sold.)

This data visualization is intended to appear like an innocent sales record keeping of a salesman; but upon close inspection, the readers will realize it's a fictional note that summarizes all the domestic slave trade bill records within Smithsonian's collections.

#### Measurements:
* Sales: young vs old, men vs women, bundle vs single
* Sell-thru vs inventory (sold slaves vs on-sale slaves)
* Competitive pricing

#### Datasets: 
All open source bills/receipts/auction notes of US domestic slave trade, 76 data points. 

#### Data visualization method:
Modern sales dashboard-ish.
I wanted this visualization to resemble the dehumanizing, matter-of-fact manner of all the slave trade bills/deeds were written in. It is intended to shove brutal reality in one's face and provoke reactions. I hope it forces readers to empathize and reflect if there is anything we do and see as normal today is totally wrong.

### Sketch 2: Portraits As Selfies
![Major Studio 1_Sketch2_Portraits_As_Selfies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42701448/132700514-1b8a0e70-778c-4a8a-a141-414d9dd12a98.jpg)

Most commissioned portraits are pure projections that the sitters wanted the viewers to see for themselves. What they wear, hold, how they sit and gaze are the narratives they control.

#### Measurement:
* Date/Gender/Occupation (known)
* Identified or unidentified
* Full body or upper body
* Face direction/facial expression?
* Wear (formal or casual)
* Holding Items

#### Datasets:
1,700 painted portraits (Ideally filter to commissioned style portraits only)
Will need to manually tag these portraits (so probably will shrink it down to 300 portraits)

#### Data visualization method:
Timeline based, combined radial chart
I wanted this visualization to show granular data in a uniformed yet diverse format. To set them on a radial chart allows both uniformity and flexibility of different chart types. It is intended to be a beautiful chart but also offers insights previously unseen.

### Sketch 3: Identified vs Unidentified 

![Major Studio 1_Sketch3_Identified_vs_Unidentified](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42701448/132700566-bbecedf4-d2a9-4ed2-b7f2-834ebef376bc.jpg)
This data visualization compares aggregated data of identified vs unidentified portrait photos within open access collections with the goal to identify and compare  characteristics.

#### Measurements: 
* Date
* Medium
* Subject (Gender, age, race, occupation, settings etc)
* Size of Portrait etc

#### Datasets:
* 362 unidentified portraits vs 8,000+ identified portraits
* Text parsing and manual tagging needed

#### Data visualization method:
* Timeline based
* 3D bar-chart to represent size and quantity, Mondrian style treemaps/stacked bar charts
* Experiment Rubik's Cube idea
I wanted this visualization to highlight both aggregated and granular data at the same time - given the amount of information, I chose to use simple rectangular based visualization element but will experiment?
